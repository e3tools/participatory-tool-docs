Technical Data Module
=====================

This module handles different types of data that can be analyzed. 

Technical Data Source
=====================
Technical data can be imported from different sources. These are:

- Raster layers
- shape files
- Tabular data

This module is used to perform specialized diagnostics. The diagnostics are made possible by enabling technical users present technical analyses with the associated interpretations and legends. Such technical analyses are specific to an area of specialization. For example, GIS experts can prepare gis technical analysis based on raster layers. The end users can then perform technical analysis for a specific region.

This module has 2 major components:

- Technical Data Source. This defines different technical data sources
- Technical Analysis. This defines different technical anayses that are available for end users to perform diagnostics
